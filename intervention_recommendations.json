This 10x overload is not a simple issue of being 'busy'; it's a fundamental breakdown of the workflow system. According to queuing theory, this level of congestion guarantees project delays, quality degradation, and team burnout. This intervention is a system reset. We will immediately halt the intake of new work to focus exclusively on clearing the existing queue. The goal is to move from a state of frantic, unproductive activity to a calm, focused, and high-throughput system.",
